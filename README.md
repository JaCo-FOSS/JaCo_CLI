# JaCo_CLI
JaCo is a desktop application based on Java and JavaFX, which will monitor and display real-time data, right to the 
machine's screen. JaCo does not pick up data from every new source, but rather it relies on 
some valuable and trustworthy resources like Johns Hopkins University's GitHub database, 
etc.
